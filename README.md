Answer:
To gauge my audience's existing knowledge and avoid overwhelming them with jargon:
I will research their background, education, and industry experience to estimate their familiarity with technical terms.
Also, I will consider their job roles and responsibilities to determine the technical concepts they're likely to be acquainted with.
Engage with them through surveys, feedback forms, or direct interactions to better understand their level of expertise and preferences.
By gaining insights into their audience's existing knowledge, i can strike the right balance in their content, using jargon only when necessary and providing clear explanations when introducing new concepts.
